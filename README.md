# IMAGE CLASSSIFICATION USING CNN IN TENSORFLOW

This project demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The goal is to accurately classify images from a given dataset into predefined categories.

DATASET:-
The dataset used is CIFAR-10 (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html), which is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision and machine learning. It serves as a standard dataset for training and evaluating machine learning algorithms, particularly for image classification tasks.

This project showcases how to:

1. Preprocess and load image data from directories

2. Build a CNN model using TensorFlow

3. Train the model on a labeled dataset

4. Evaluate the performance using validation/test data

5. Save and reload the trained model

6. Visualize training metrics like accuracy and loss
