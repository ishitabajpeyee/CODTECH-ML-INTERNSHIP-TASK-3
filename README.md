# IMAGE CLASSSIFICATION USING CNN IN TENSORFLOW

This project demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The goal is to accurately classify images from a given dataset into predefined categories.

This project showcases how to:

1. Preprocess and load image data from directories

2. Build a CNN model using TensorFlow

3. Train the model on a labeled dataset

4. Evaluate the performance using validation/test data

5. Save and reload the trained model

6. Visualize training metrics like accuracy and loss
